"""Example of creating and downloading multiple orders.

This is an example of submitting two orders, waiting for them to complete, and
downloading them. The orders each clip a set of images to a specific area of
interest (AOI), so they cannot be combined into one order.

[Planet Explorer](https://www.planet.com/explorer/) was used to define
the AOIs and get the image ids.
